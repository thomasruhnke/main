<h1>ComiCore's Employees</h1>
<div class="parent">
    <div class="div5">
    <h2>Branden</h2>
    <p>Branden is a really fun and hard working employee. 
        He is the person that you will talk to when you need any help. 
        He runs our customer support, and has been doing so for many years. 
        Dedicated at his job we have not heard of a single complaint. New? Don't worry he's the man.
        Having read most of the comics we offer he knows just what to suggest.
    </p>

<div class="div6"> 
<h2>Han</h2>
    <p>Han is one of our newest employees just being hired on a few months ago as a trainee. 
    However, she worked really hard and continued to show a strong work ethic.
    Han went from only being apart time employee to being hired on full time. She runs the cashier side of things.
    She really enjoys it here and I'm sure she is as joyed to see you at our store!

<div class="div7">
    <h2>Kobe</h2>
    <p>Kobe is by far the youngest of all of our staff. However he is also our longest coming customer. 
        When we first opened Kobe was one of the first customers. He was only seven and he continued to come here, so by the age of fourteen
        I offered him a job. He is now in his early 20's and manages the store and knows it almost better than me. By far our most qualified.
    </p>

<div class="div8">
    <h2>Noah</h2>
    <p>Noah has been here a while and continued to show strong and solid work ethic and wonderful customer service so we awarded him with employee of the month.
        Hope we continue to see the work!
    </p>
